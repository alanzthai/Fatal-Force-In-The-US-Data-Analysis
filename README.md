Presentation: 

## Background

In the United States, use of deadly force by police has been a high-profile and contentious issue. 1000 people are shot and killed by US cops each year. The ever-growing argument is that the US has a flawed Law Enforcement system that costs too many innocent civilians their lives. In this project, we will analyze one of Americaâ€™s hottest political topics, which encompasses issues ranging from institutional racism to the role of Law Enforcement personnel in society.

## Datasets
The datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/oliafedyshyn/fatal-force) provide the data of victims of police brutality from 2015-2017. Data from 2015-early 2017 is the training set and data from
early 2017-mid 2017 is the testing set.

## Dependencies

- Pandas - Data Analysis
- Matplotlib - Data Visualization
- scikit-learn - Machine Learning

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Merge and clean the data, removing any outliers.
- Which state has the most fatal police shootings? Which city is the most dangerous?
- What is the most common way of being armed?
- What is the age distribution of the victims? Compare age distribution of different races.
- Compare the total number of people killed per race. Compare the number of people killed per race as a proportion of respective races. What difference do you observe?
