## Background

In the United States, use of deadly force by police has been a high-profile and contentious issue. 1000 people are shot and killed by US cops each year. The ever-growing argument is that the US has a flawed Law Enforcement system that costs too many innocent civilians their lives. In this project, we will analyze one of Americaâ€™s hottest political topics, which encompasses issues ranging from institutional racism to the role of Law Enforcement personnel in society.
